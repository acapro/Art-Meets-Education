    short_about: 'Art Meets Education is an organisation, which educates through photography. Here, children from financially disadvantaged backgrounds are given the opportunity to produce their own works of art. The proceeds generated from the sales of their art will provide the financial means for their formal education.  In addition, photography will serve as a medium, through which the children can channel their feelings and transfer their daily experiences into something they can hold in their hands.'
